## Overview:

This is a team-developed application designed for auto dealers. It serves three main functions:

**Customer and Vehicle Records:** It maintains a comprehensive database of customers and various types of vehicles available for sale.
**Personalized Recommendations:** The application generates a list of recommended Cars, SUVs, and Trucks for each customer. These recommendations are based on a compatibility percentage calculated by comparing the features of the vehicles with the customerâ€™s list of preferred features and budget.
**Payroll Management:** The application also manages the payroll of agents, calculating their commissions based on sales.
In essence, this application not only helps auto dealers manage their inventory and customer information but also assists in providing personalized vehicle recommendations and managing agent payroll. This leads to enhanced customer satisfaction and efficient business operations.
